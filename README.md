Welcome to the COTI TypeScript Examples repository, a set of examples for interacting with the COTI blockchain using two different packages: [COTI Ethers](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-ethers) and the official [COTI TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-typescript). These examples are designed to help developers quickly get started with COTI blockchain integration, showcasing common operations like creating wallets, performing the onboarding procedure, deploying contracts, and interacting with smart contracts.
